How I Saved My Poco F6 from a Hard Brick (Without Spending â‚¹24,000!)

So, my Poco F6 got hard-bricked. Dead. No fastboot, no recovery, no sign of life.

I took it to the official service center, and guess what? They told me my motherboard was corrupted and quoted a massive â‚¹24,000 for a replacement! No way was I paying that.

Instead, I decided to fix it myselfâ€”and I did! Hereâ€™s how you can unbrick any Xiaomi device like I did, and save thousands of rupees in the process.

Step 1: Buy an EDL V2 Cable

To enter Emergency Download (EDL) mode, you need an EDL V2 cable. This is a must-have tool for fixing bricked Xiaomi devices.

I bought mine for just â‚¹370 from this site.

Step 2: Get the Right Tools and Firmware

Youâ€™ll need a few tools to flash your device:

Paid & Free Tools You Can Use

Xiaomi Anonymous Tool â€“ Buy credits & flash (Recommended)

Phoenix Flash Tool â€“ Another flashing tool I tested

MiFlash Tool â€“ Essential for flashing HyperOS


You can buy credits for flashing from various sites. I got mine directly from a Telegram/WhatsApp reseller for a better discount: https://in-gsm.com/cart/group/708/service/server/groupname/Xiaomi-Anonymous-Toolxiaomiauthorg-OFFICIAL-RESELLER

Download the Correct HyperOS ROM

Do NOT flash the latest HyperOS version (it wonâ€™t work).

Instead, download an older HyperOS 1.0.2 Fastboot ROM.

Check your deviceâ€™s community for the correct ROM.

Step 3: Flash HyperOS and Fix Your Device

1. Use Xiaomi Anonymous Tool to Flash HyperOS 1.0.2

Connect your phone via the EDL V2 cable and use the tool to flash the older HyperOS fastboot file.

2. Use MiFlash Tool to Flash Another HyperOS Version

After the first flash, use MiFlash to flash any other HyperOS 1.0x fastboot ROM.

âš  IMPORTANT: Before flashing, UNTICK "Relock Bootloader".

This option is hidden under the progress bar in MiFlash.

If you accidentally tick it, your device will brick again.

If that happens, disconnect the cable and restart the process.


3. If Step 2 Fails, Try Again

If you donâ€™t follow the steps correctly, your device may brick again.

Just repeat the process, and youâ€™ll eventually fix it.

The Result: My Poco F6 Was Back to Normal!

After following these steps, my Poco F6 was fully unbrickedâ€”working just like before, without spending â‚¹24,000 on a motherboard replacement!

Now, I can even flash any AOSP ROM on my device.

Final Tips: You Can Unbrick Any Xiaomi Device!

If your device got bricked due to software flashing, you can 100% unbrick it yourself.

Some older devices even have free tools available.

Always keep an EDL V2 cable handyâ€”you never know when youâ€™ll need it.

You can even unlock your bootloader by flashing an engineering ROM via EDL mode.
